/**
 * The run's second economy. Corruption rises only through choices — chest
 * tithes, void credit, item pickups, greed time — and never passively. This
 * system owns the numbers and the band events; what the world *does* about
 * them (blight visuals, Voidtouched spawns, route gates) belongs to the
 * systems that listen.
 *
 * Host-authoritative like every other state change: `feed` is a no-op off the
 * host, and clients will learn the world value from replication (later plan).
 * Deliberately consumes NO ctx.rng draws — there is nothing to roll here, and
 * staying off the shared stream is what keeps sp-equivalence green.

    // and the base stacks were charged at their own tier when they arrived.
